<h2 align="Center">
As the first quarter ends, I find myself reflecting on the struggles I faced. I struggled in the lessons taught. It was really challenging to understand the activities and the performances tasks especially the ones involving coding. In my opinion, the hardest lesson was forms due to the amount of tags and attributes i needed to memorize and understand. but Whether it was quizes, unexpected challenges, or feeling overwhelmed, each obstacle taught me valuable lessons. I realized the importance of resilience and seeking support when needed. Moving forward, I aim to do better, adjusting my approach to understand the lessons in the next quarters.
